I designed my own telescope!

This is a pretty simple Newtonian Reflector style telescope, with a 114mm primary mirror, and a 25mm secondary mirror. I'm making it because I really love taking pictures of the stars, and was able to do some cool stuff a few weeks ago with a telescope at a family member's house! Hopefully this is a (comparatively) low cost way of getting into the field. There's a couple of great dark sky spots near me (Seattle), and hopefully I can update with some awesome pictures. 
Hopefully, I can get some pretty cool images of galaxies and other cool objects, and I've included a barlow lens which should help with planetary photography. 

I designed as much as possible myself! Unfortunatley I don't have the capabilities to make motors or precision optics, and I'm using a modified version of the Crayford Focuser, as I'm not experienced enough with precision optics.
