## 12/23/2025 - Lots of placements, reading and designing, and some design  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

I've been inspired! I spent a few hours researching the components, doing some quick calculations, and reading spec sheets.
I'm now ready to start on my PCB, which will sorta be like a carrier board for a RP zero 2. 
Hopefully I can get that component done in a few days, and then work on CAD modeling for the actual telescope! ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjg0OTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--1707462c3c246de6140aeea73a00cac2c12e10ff/image.png)
  

## 12/24/2025 6 PM - Design done, components assigned!  

_Time spent: 4.0h_

I finished up designing the PCB, and assigned footprints for every part! Took a lot of back and forth researching, but I think I have EVERYTHING I need, 100% correct. Ready to start actual PCB design!!


  

## 12/24/2025 10 PM - Started power management  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjkxNTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--07bc12b4dfe6781e63e06f7371b55d253c40f073/image.png)

Started just laying out the power input and managing components, tbh, most of this board is about that, and just making sure we can drive the motors needed to rotate the telescope.   

## 12/25/2025 1 PM - PCB Done  

_Time spent: 5.0h_

PCB is done! made a few more tweaks to the design to have the right symbols and footprints, and laid out everything where it belongs!
As the voltage and heat generated is pretty high, the ground fills needed to have enough copper mass for this board are quite large. 
I may end up having to add a heatsink, we will see. 


  

## 12/25/2025 10 PM - Started CAD design  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjk3NDIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--67779ba9752eda89d61e5c24d77265c33a04ad04/image.png)

Spent a while going back and forth, and re learning CAD. There will be 4 of these segments, segments 2&3 will just be this, segment 4 (the top) will have the aperture and primary lens, segment 1 will have the secondary lens and the camera system. 

Additional things to design will be the electronics box, several rings to clamp on, lens mounts, and a stand
  

## 12/26/2025 12 PM - Unique segments done  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAwNjgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3fd7161b30727d1246e93a70f70ec37423fb6842/image.png)![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAwNjksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--b3d2613a8c4c062e00c692d12a51feef945a1f6e/image.png)

Modules 1 & 4 (the end pieces) are in! One of them has six holes for heat set screws, and the other one has a hole for mounting the primary focusing mirror.
I'm really bad at cad lolol  

## 12/26/2025 2 PM - Primary mirror cell  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAxMjMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--b7eb78a44afa381285b53993624e5b824d733eec/image.png)

Finished CAD modeling the primary mirror holder!
It'll be holding this mirror: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802406856110.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt#nav-specification

I think it shouldddd fit, gonna have to make some clips to hold the mirror down, but theres also slots for the colimitation (basically just fancy word for alignment) screws.

Ideal vision is the screws tilt it into alignment, and then the clips keep it there while the telescope moves  

## 12/26/2025 10 PM - Secondary mirror holder  

_Time spent: 2.5h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAzNjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3a38cdcd7f63d3f4c434c22b58dfdbe7cc198b20/image.png)

By far the most complex thing I have modeled so far, it's not too bad, but took a lot of research and iteration. the mirror will be glued on, so hopefully we can use the 25mm that comes with the set im buying.

## 12/27/2025 9 AM - Minor alignment tweak  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzA1NzEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--d8d4b9a3acd9a155293d5f816ffbcdeebb88e436/image.png)

Spent some time rotating components by 45 degrees in order to ensure that the bolts would be away from the main opening for the focuser, also researched and found a 3d model of a focuser online! (precision optics is beyond me)  

## 12/27/2025 10 AM - Mount designed for eyepiece/focuser  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzA2MzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--784cda9cf84bef7e1b930df3d5a4b8773d1e79fa/image.png)

This took forever cuz i had to swap quite a few times! As it turns out, most focusers are designed for a curved body, and so I spent quite a while trying and failing to make a curved boss, anyways, I found this 3d printed one, which should both save cost, and lets me have a much simpler flat boss!  

## 12/27/2025 9 PM - re did the primary mirror cell :(  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzEwMDMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--cac51b3f7066594612c79b46a5866c80fd5f1817/image.png)

Yup, screenshot of shame, idk, ive spent probably a solid 8 hours on this, im listing 4 cuz that seems more honest (reels may have been scrolled)

anyways uhh yeah i redid this like 5 different ways and was considering just stealing the hadley's design (cuz its good) but no. so now we have a proper floating plate setup, and ive got quite a few more parts in the bom.

gonna go work on simple stuff tomorrow morning to get warmed up, then jump into the mount, which is hopefully the last thing. 

  

## 12/28/2025 3 PM - Caps  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Late start today, got back into it by modeling the 3 different plugs/caps. Took some time as I intend to do friction fit, so I had to load up various models, i also did a test assembly of the telescope to make sure stuff is fitting and logical.

## 12/28/2025 7 PM - Electronics box  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE2OTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--ad51f9fb829c0aa5b43f78e74bddc25bb21cf059/image.png)

Fooled around for a while on how I wanted to do this, and then just decided to keep it simple.
There's no need to extreme precision here, it's just to organize the electronics.   

## 12/28/2025 10 PM - Mounting hardware  

_Time spent: 2.0h_

Based on my research, i have designed a system that uses two rings, a plate to basically hold the rings together, and then two forks which attach to the plate. 
next up is the rotating base, and motor attachments, and then we're kinda done lol



  

## 12/29/2025 9 AM - Continued work on mount  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE5ODIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c402d2aef96fd03e97a4adec5bd5a20a3e343569/image.png)

Found a lazy suzan bearing online to use, and started designing mount to interface with it. I really really hope i have these measurements correct, as the seller is not very clear on the specs, if all else fails, there are other means of mounting it lol

  

## 12/29/2025 3 PM - Mounting plate and attitude fork adjustments and other stuff  

_Time spent: 2.5h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzIxMTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e0b89e032f3cddfeb35b2b79f43780f76183dd62/image.png)
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzIxMTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--86d66d8200e615736a652e41c2c7c18dbe583572/image.png)

Found a motor WITH a worm gear, made a mounting plate for it, and then updated the attitude fork. Then, after reading some stuff online, i realized its a really bad idea to do close fit holes when 3d printing, cuz the material can contract, so I had to go through and swap everything out for normal fit, including some of the hexagons, which are inscribed inside circles, which is all just extra fun.   

## 12/29/2025 5 PM - Motor mounts are actually correct now  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzIyMDEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--8bbcfd5e33095b8b086c04465688c919136793ed/image.png)

Using like a pulley thing for the azimuth, had to update both of them to use slots cuz turns out, they need to be slots.

Ended up doing a ton of research work cuz i have no idea whats going on here, and now i have a mount that I think SHOULD fit...


  

## 12/29/2025 9 PM - Feet, and about a billion small fixes  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzIzMjAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--43e8ed7a29690e27d28ba783006a810b286dabfa/image.png)

Added some feet! Will add friction pads here. Also changed more dumb stuff, such as wrong motor mounts, backwards joints, ect ect, all just logic things or stuff that hadn't been updated.
Gonna do a full test build tomorrow, and hopefully ship.   

## 12/30/2025 - Did a test assembly  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzI0OTIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--34398d961a38aca888d39ddfd77e4f692c649b96/image.png)

Assembled all the parts together! Found a bunch more issues with the design... anyways, they're all fixed now! Hoping to get everything together into a BOM, and submit production files today for review!  

## 1/1/2026 - Assembled bom and final stuff  

_Time spent: 5.0h_

Final assembly of everything, really took FOREVER cuz i had to find everything on aliexpress, im gonna be buying a lot from my local hardware store, hopefully the grant covers that.
